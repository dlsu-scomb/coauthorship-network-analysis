## Abstract
Research collaboration presents solutions to various problems that independent researchers might encounter; however, establishing collaboration also poses challenges for most of these researchers. In this study, we created a co-authorship network map of Filipino mathematicians using Elsevier's Scopus database. We identified the top five institutions with the largest number of Filipino mathematicians, each with at least one publication in Scopus. Various network analysis metrics were performed on the map to establish a baseline for future co-authorship network research. Mathematicians were ranked using both the PageRank algorithm and betweenness centrality to highlight important and bridging figures, respectively. The Leiden community detection algorithm was employed to cluster the network map, revealing infrequent collaborations within the top Philippine institutions. This highlights the need to strengthen collaborative efforts among these institutions. By illustrating the research landscape, this study sheds light on Filipino mathematicians' research, contributing to the enhancement of mathematics research productivity and collaboration in the country.
